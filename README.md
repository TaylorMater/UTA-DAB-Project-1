### How does the average salary per job title vary by experience?
Based on the information gathered and the graph presented below, we can see how the experience level on each job affects differently depending on the job title. 
As we can see, Applied Scientist can earn around the same or a bigger salary on an entry level compared to other titles as mid, senior and even executive level.
We can also observe how Data Analyst salary does not vary much depending on experience. Others can go from $75K to $200K compared to Data Analyst which according to our data varies only from $75K to $125K.
