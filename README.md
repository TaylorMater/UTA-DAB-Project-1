# Data Science Salary Analysis
UTA Data Analysis Bootcamp Project 1

-----------------------------

## This project seeks to analyze a robust dataset encompassing data science salaries spanning four years (2020-2024), to extract valuable insights. It will delve into patterns, trends and factors that impact the compensation of professionals in the data science field. The dataset incorporates details like job titles, experience levels, geographic locations and other pertinent factors affecting salaries within the realm of data science.

## Research Questions

### How does the average salary per job title vary by experience?
Based on the information gathered and the graph presented below, we can see how the experience level on each job affects differently depending on the job title. 
As we can see, Applied Scientist can earn around the same or a bigger salary on an entry level compared to other titles as mid, senior and even executive level.
We can also observe how Data Analyst salary does not vary much depending on experience. Others can go from $75K to $200K compared to Data Analyst which according to our data varies only from $75K to $125K.
