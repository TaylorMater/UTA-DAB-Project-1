### Riley's Takeaways from this Project


For future reference, if VS code starts slowing down a ton, change the default language server to Pylance. Helps make it faster. (Language Server in settings for Python). Also, restart any extensions with long boottimes (>500 ms), if possible. 


Jupyter notebooks are a pain to merge. Make sure you have proper merge tools set up, and are familiar with them. A good strategy if merging is not tenable is to give each individual their own notebook and branch and have them only push to that branch. We can always manually merge and delete the branches afterwards. 


Going forward, figure out how to properly use conda environments, and set one up for each assignment/project. Then you can track exactly what libraries and versioning you are using. Once you do a setup once, it should get much easier. It well also help you guarantee errors due to different library versions.
